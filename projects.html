                DARKTOMB
            </h2>
            <p>
                DARKTOMB is a 3d first person puzzle game I made solo in Unity. The main feature being the tile based movement and ghosts that follow you if they have line of sight. This is a complete, if small, game. I focus mostly on sound design and atmosphere in this one. The woosh of ghosts moving, the sound of steps on the stone floor and the howl of wind from the outside slowly quieting as you go further into the tomb.

                Den flydende tidslinje
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a skole group project made for the danish natural museum Naturama for an exhibition about the permian period. In this project I focused on coding the game while the others the visual elements. The game itself was made in Unity and is a puzzle game where you have to reconstruct what the earth land masses looked like long ago using the modern continents. The game was meant to give an insight into how the earth is not a static thing but a thing that changes though very slowly.

                Space War!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Space war! is a 1v1 spaceship shooter with a blackhole in the center made solo in a 24 hours game jam. The theme was ‘recreation’. Each player has control over a spaceship with front face guns, currently spiraling into a blackhole in the center of the screen. The goal for each player is to shoot the other without themselves falling into the blackhole. I also focused a lot on making a coherent aesthetic in this game, making the game look and sound like you are playing it on an ancient computer.

                Man rowing is a school animation project. A short funny animation of a fisher rowing really fast in to another ship which I made, alone, in 1 day. It won the people's choice award. The only thing I didn't have time to add was sound.
